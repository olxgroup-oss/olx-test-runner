## Overview
Validate command validates whether tests are properly formatted.

All tests should:
1. Be wrapped in groups.
2. Have `setUp`, `setUpAll`, `tearDown`, `tearDownAll` functions in groups.

Not following these will result in flaky tests.

## Command reference

You can run the validate command using the following syntax:
```
dart pub global run test_runner validate <options>
```

#### Available Options
- `--test-path` (Required):
  Specifies the path to the directory containing the test files to be validated. This ensures only relevant tests are targeted during validation.


## Example
```shell
dart pub global run test_runner validate --test-path ./test_files 
```


```shell
